# Stat-390
For the fall 2023 capstone COVID-19 group project

In the 'Data' folder, you can find the original dataset. In the 'After Midterm Report' Folder, you can find all of our Data Prepration steps, chronologically by week. These steps are also included in each persons respective folders, explained below. The 'EDA' folder contains our initial exploratory data analysis. You can find our Weekly Reports in our 'Weekly Reports' Folder.

In order to run our code, you must run the files for each person. Each person made 6 different models (ARIMA, Auto-ARIMA, Prophet Single, Propher Multiple, XGBoost, LSTM) in order to predict new cases in each country that we chose (USA, Brazil, Germany, Nigeria, China, Australia). In the folder, 'Sid_Models', this contains all the models created by Sid Taneja. The file Data Preparation & PreProcessing must be run first (this produces that data .csv files). In order to run each model, each ipynb file named after each model can be run individually, and the results can be reproduced.

In the folder, 'Ryan_Models', this contains all the models created by Ryan Choe. The file Data Preparation & Imputation must be run first, which then produces all of the files in the 'Data' subfolder. In order to run each model, each ipynb file named after each model can be run individually, and the results can be reproduced.

The folder, 'Rakin_Models' can be disregarded, as Rakin has dropped the class.
